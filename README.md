# ViscoPINN
MATLAB code for physics-informed viscosity prediction of multicomponent aqueous solutions

ViscoPINN: Viscosity Prediction Software
Overview

ViscoPINN is a MATLAB-based software package for predicting temperature-dependent viscosity of multicomponent aqueous mixtures using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework. The software supports mixtures of up to 17 pure components and enables both direct PINN inference and optional Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) extrapolation toward the glass transition regime.

The package is distributed in two complementary forms:

Standalone Windows executable (.exe) for plug-and-play use without MATLAB

MATLAB function-based interface for scripting, automation, and reproducibility

Package Contents

The repository/package folder contains the following files:

Core Files

ViscosityPredictor.m
Main MATLAB function implementing the PINN-based viscosity prediction. This function performs input normalization, network inference, optional VFT fitting, and output formatting.

PINN.mat
Trained Physics-Informed Neural Network model required for all predictions.

mixture_data.mat
Supporting mixture property data used internally by the model.

Tg_fitted_VFT.mat
Pre-fitted parameters used for VFT extrapolation when enabled.

Example and Output Files

Example.m
Demonstration MATLAB script showing how to call ViscosityPredictor programmatically, define mixture composition, specify temperature range, and visualize results.

MyResults.xlsx
Example output file generated by the software when exporting predicted viscosity–temperature data.

Standalone Application

MyAppInstaller_web.exe
A standalone Windows executable providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for viscosity prediction.
This version does not require MATLAB and is intended for user-friendly, interactive use.

Standalone GUI Application (No MATLAB Required)

The ViscoPINN GUI provides a plug-and-play interface for viscosity prediction and is suitable for users without programming experience.

GUI Structure

The interface consists of three main panels:

1. Input Panel

Users define mixture composition using mole fractions or mass fractions

Supports up to 17 components

Fractions are internally normalized by the software

2. Control Panel

Temperature range specification:

Lower bound (°C)

Upper bound (°C)

Step size (°C)

VFT Fit option:

Unchecked (default): Direct PINN inference

Highest accuracy within the training range: −20 °C to 35 °C

Checked: PINN + VFT fitting

Enables theoretical extrapolation toward the glass transition temperature

Buttons:

Run Prediction

Export to Excel

3. Output Panel

Displays predicted viscosity as a continuous function of temperature

Output units: centipoise (cP)

Provides immediate visualization of non-linear temperature and composition effects

MATLAB Function Usage

Advanced users may directly call the prediction engine from MATLAB for scripting, batch processing, or integration with other models.

Basic Usage
finalResults = ViscosityPredictor( ...
    moleFractions, ...
    LowT, StepT, HighT, ...
    useVFT, ...
    outputFile );

Input Arguments
Argument	Description
moleFractions	1×17 vector of mole fractions (must sum to 1)
LowT	Lower temperature bound (°C)
StepT	Temperature increment (°C)
HighT	Upper temperature bound (°C)
useVFT	Logical flag (true / false) for VFT fitting
outputFile	Excel filename for exported results
Example MATLAB Script
clc; clear; close all;

% Initialize mole fractions
myMoleFractions = zeros(1,17);
myMoleFractions(1) = 0.5;  % Water
myMoleFractions(2) = 0.5;  % Methanol

% Temperature range
LowT  = -20;
HighT = 35;
StepT = 0.5;

% Enable VFT extrapolation
useVFT = true;

% Output file
outputFile = 'MyResults.xlsx';

% Run prediction
finalResults = ViscosityPredictor( ...
    myMoleFractions, LowT, StepT, HighT, useVFT, outputFile );

% Extract results
Temperature = finalResults.Temperature;
Viscosity   = finalResults.Viscosity;

% Plot

plot(Temperature, Viscosity, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2);
grid on;
xlabel('Temperature (°C)');
ylabel('Viscosity (cP)');
title('Predicted Viscosity vs Temperature');

Notes on Model Validity

Direct PINN predictions are most accurate within −20 °C to 35 °C

VFT extrapolation enables extension toward lower temperatures but should be interpreted as theoretical extrapolation

The model is trained on experimentally validated multicomponent datasets described in the accompanying publication
